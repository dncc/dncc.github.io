I've found today an elegant and intuitive approach to derive equations of present and
future values for $n$ annuity payments ($pv_{n}, fv_{n}$). It doesn't require much algebraic
manipulation and its quite easy to visualize. I'm going to write it down so I have reference.

<p>
This is also opportunity for me to try <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MatJax.js</a>, JavaScript library for writing LaTeX formulas in HTML :).

Let's just imagine two infinitely long time lines of payments. At first timeline
payments start at point 1 and at the second timeline they start at time n+1.
Here is what they might look like:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}

    -------| Payment Timeline1 |------->

            pmt(1)    pmt(2)     pmt(N)    pmt(n+1)   pmt(n+2)  pmt(Inf)
    |---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
    0         1         2    ...   n         n+1        n+2  ...  Inf


    -------| Payment Timeline2 |------>
                                           pmt(1)     pmt(2)    pmt(Inf)
    |---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
    0         1         2    ...   n         n+1        n+2  ...  Inf


{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Where pmt(1), pmt(2), ... etc. are obviously payments at time 1, 2, ... etc,
and we assume that all payments are equal to each other (i.e. pmt(1) = pmt(2) = ... = pmt(Inf) = pmt).
</p>
<p>
Once we are finished, it will be enough to keep this image in our mind in order
to derive the $pv_{n}$ and $fv_{n}$ formulas. No need to remember long sequences of algebraic
calculations any more. Just two infinite time axis with different starting points (it can't be
much easier than that :)). Enough talk, let's make use of our pretty image now.
</p>

The simple fact of finance says that in order to obtain present values we have to discount them
with interest rate $r$. So the present values on Timeline1 at point in time 0 ($PIT_{0}$) for
payments pmt(1), pmt(2), ..., pmt(n), ..., pmt($\infty$). will be equal to:

\begin{equation}
pv_{1} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)}, pv_{2} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^2},
..., pv_{n} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^n}, ..., pv_{\infty} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^{\infty}}
\end{equation}

respectively. So the sum of all present value payments on Timeline1 will be:

$$ pv_{Timeline1} = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} pv(i) = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}
\frac{pmt}{(1+r)^i} = pmt * \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}.$$

Now, note that the present values at $PIT_{n}$ on Timeline2 are equal exactly
to the present values on Timeline1 at $PIT_{0}$. So in order to obtain present
values at $PIT_{0}$ on Timeline2 we need to additionally discount all present
values at $PIT_{n}$ on this timeline with $\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}$ discount factor.
If we do this the sum of all present value payments on Timeline2 will be:

$$ pv_{Timeline2} = pv_{Timeline1} * \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}. $$

Now we have formulas with lots of summation terms (for infinite number of future
payments), so we need something simpler, shorter and more handy in order to calculate
$pv_{n}$ and $fv_{n}$ values of $n$ future payments. In order to get there we need to
know just one small mathematical truth about, so called, geometric progressions.
Let's see what they are.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
 Geometric progression of A (where A is constant less than 1) can be defined as
 follows: $$ S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} A^i $$

 It is easy to see that $$S = \frac{A}{1-A},$$ we just multiply $S$ with $A$
 so that $A*S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} A^{i+1}$ and when substract $S*A$ from $S$
 we get $S - S*A = A$, and indeed $S = \frac{A}{1-A}$.
</p></blockquote>


<p>
If we apply this cute trick to the sumation term of $pv_{Timeline1}$ equation we can
simplify it significantly:

$$
 pv_{Timeline1} = pmt * \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+r)^i} = pmt * \frac{\frac{1}{(1+r)^i}}{1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}}  = \frac{pmt}{r}.
$$

So $pv_{Timeline2}$ becomes:

$$
 pv_{Timeline2} = \frac{pmt}{r} * \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}.
$$

Now, if we substract $pv_{Timeline2}$ from $pv_{Timeline1}$ we will get simple
formula for the present value of the first $n$ payments:

$$
 pv_{n} = pv_{Timeline1} - pv_{Timeline2} = \frac{pmt}{r} - \frac{pmt}{r}*\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\
        = pmt * \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r*(1+r)^n} \right).
$$

Voila! There it is, our first formula. The second equation (for future value of $n$ annuities - $fv_{n}$) can be obtained
from the first ($pv_{n}$) even more easily. It is just present value of $n$ annuities compounded to $n$ periods. So:

$$
 fv_{n} = pv_{n} * (1+r)^n = pmt * \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r*(1+r)^n} \right) * (1+r)^n \\
        = pmt * \left( \frac{(1+r)^n}{r} - \frac{1}{r} \right).
$$
