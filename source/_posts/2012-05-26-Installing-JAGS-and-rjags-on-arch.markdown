I have been evaluating available options for developing Bayesian and state-space models in R recently so I stumbled upon JAGS and rjags. Since I had trouble to install them on my Arch Linux I thought it might be good to create a brief record of the whole process. [Here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/forums/forum/610037/topic/4996525) 
is the thread that was useful to me to identify and solve the problem.

JAGS installation went well. There was no standard Arch package for JAGS so I built it from the source, which was quite straightforward 

{% highlight text %}
./configure 
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Next, I tried to install 'rjags' package within R: 

{% highlight text %}
install.packages('rjags') 
{% endhighlight %}

and I got this error message: 

{% highlight text %}
...
*** installing help indices 
** building package indices ... 
Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rjags', details:
call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) 
error: unable to load shared object 
'/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rjags/libs/rjags.so': 
libjags.so.3: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory 
ERROR: installing package indices failed * 
removing '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rjags'
...
{% endhighlight %}

First, I tried various things with the previous R function (some of which, for instance, were to include 'dependecies=TRUE' and jags module paths as arguments to this function). That didn't work. After quite a few failed trials I found out that jags libraries were in '/usr/local/lib' directory and it was not included in my linker path. I checked this with:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo ldconfig -p | grep local
{% endhighlight %}

and since '/usr/local/lib' didn't appear on *stdout* I added this line in the new '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/jags.conf' file. Than, in order to activate linker paths and check if '/usr/local/lib' was included I run:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo ldconfig -v | grep /usr/local/lib
{% endhighlight %}

I tried 'rjags' installation again with:

{% highlight text %}
sudo R --with-jags-modules=/usr/local/lib/JAGS/modules-3 \
CMD INSTALL ~/downloads/rjags_3-2.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

and this time it was installed! It remaines just to develop some Bayesian models for predicting a stock price movements or whatever, and make myself owfully rich ;).
