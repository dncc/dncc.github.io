<p>I had to deal with some broken csv files today. The Windows's end of line characters ('<sup>M')</sup> were all over the place and some csv rows were broken up into several text lines. They looked something like the following text (one csv row is broken into two text lines with each line ending with '<sup>M'):</sup></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">29.12.2005;1450,00;5,07;6.036;1399.00;1399.00^M
;1450.00;-;-;KT^M
28.12.2005;1380,00;-1,43;4.000;1380.00;1380.00^M
;1380.00;-;-;KT^M
27.12.2005;1400,00;-0,64;166;1384.00;1384.00^M
;1400.00;-;-;KT^M
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>So, here is the sed solution I came up with after quite a struggle.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">sed  -e :a -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/^M//;&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;/[0-9]$/N; s/\n//; ta&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
input_file.csv &gt; output_file.csv
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Here is what it does:
The first expression ':a' creates a named label "a". The second expression substitutes occurrences of '<sup>M'</sup> with an empty string. The third expression looks to see if the current line ends with a digit. If it does, it joins it with the line following it using the "N" command. Then the newline between joined lines is erased with "s/\n//" command. If the substitution was successful further execution is branched to the beginning of expression and do the same again, in case that we might have another digit at the end. If the substitution was not successful, the line did not end with a digit and we print it out.</p>

<h1> <a href="/blog/2010/10/02/memoizing-functions.html"> Memoizing Functions </a> </h1>

<div class="date">
    published: 02 Oct 2010
</div>

<p>I've been going  through some parts of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516178/">The Ruby Programming Language</a> book recently, the best book about Ruby language I've read and here are some interesting bits about memoization that I found:</p>

<blockquote><p>Memoization is a functional programming term for caching the results of
a function invocation. If a function always returns the same value when
passed the same arguments, if there is reason to believe that the same
arguments will be used repeatedly, and if the computation it performs
is somewhat expensive, then memoization may be a useful optimization...</p></blockquote>

<p>While I was reading about basic functional programming concepts, I picked up some FP terminology. For instance <em>"a function always returns the same value when passed the same arguments"</em> is called <strong>referential transparency</strong> in FP lingo, which is important concept since it assumes variables are non mutable. With this feature, chances of a bug occurring as a result of so called (mutability) <strong>side effects</strong> cease to exist.</p>

<p>The book offers Ruby solution for the memoization of the Proc and Method objects:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Functional</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">memoize</span>
    <span class="n">cache</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="err">   </span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">|</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="err">   </span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">cache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">has_key?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="err"> </span> <span class="err">   </span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">cache</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="err">   </span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Proc</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Functional</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Method</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Functional</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I've removed comments for the sake of readability. Here is basically what function does: if there is no results for the particular <code>args</code>
a procedure/method will be executed and the results cached and returned, otherwise already cached results will be returned.
What I find unusual here is that the entire array of arguments is the hash key.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to excercise memoizing technique and  decided to try it out on Fibonnaci sequences:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Generally, this sequence can be defined in the form of the function F(n) such that:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">F(n) = 0, if n = 0
F(n) = 1, if n = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+2), otherwise.
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In Ruby this definition can be translated in straightforward, but,  from the performance point of view,  terrible lambda function.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1"># Fibonnaci numbers computed with</span>
<span class="c1"># a tree recursive algorithm without memoization.</span>
<span class="n">fib_wo_mem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="n">fib_wo_mem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib_wo_mem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>We can see why this function is so terrible. It will do a lot of redundant computation. Only fib_wo_mem(1) and fib_wo_mem(0) will
be computed F(n+1) times, and if we know that F(n) grows exponentially WRT n, than we get an idea of how
bad this can be. Even with such a bad choise our friend memoization might save us to some extent.</p>

<p>First we need to slightly modify the above fib_wo_mem function:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">fib_with_mem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span>
<span class="err">   </span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="err">   </span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="err">   </span> <span class="n">fib_with_mem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib_with_mem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">memoize</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Let's compare these two:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Benchmark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bmbm</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span>

   <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;fib_wo_mem&#39;</span><span class="p">){</span> <span class="n">fib_wo_mem</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Rehearsal -----------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1"># fib_with_mem   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000175)</span>
<span class="c1"># fib_wo_mem     0.400000   0.000000   0.400000 (  0.413050)</span>
<span class="c1"># --------------------------------------- total: 0.400000sec</span>
<span class="c1">#                    user     system       total        real</span>
<span class="c1"># fib_with_mem   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000019)</span>
<span class="c1"># fib_wo_mem     0.410000   0.010000   0.420000 (  0.410216)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Because everything is already cached after the first execution "fib_with_mem" is about 10 times faster the second time.
So it is fair  to  take into account just Rehearsal times.  Even just for the first execution the difference is striking.
Fibonnaci function with memoization is more than 2,000 times faster than its w/o memoization counterpart.
(I used here number 20 because with anything bigger <code>fib_wo_mem</code> function gets unbearably slow. You can try it.)</p>

<p>After this we may be interested to see  how this recursive, not_appropriate_solution,
compares with a more efficient implementation of fibonnaci function.</p>

<p>More efficient solution may be to use pair of integers a and b with iterative, parallel assignments: a = a + b, b = a.
After n such iterations a and b should be equal to F(n+1) and F(n) respectively. In order to come to this solution
we only need to apply basic rule of the sequence F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) in n iterations. Each iteration will take two last numbers
from the sequence as an input, and produce next two as an output which than will serve as an input for next iteration...</p>

<p>Here is how it can be implemented:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1"># linear iteration fibonaci</span>
<span class="n">lin_fib_iter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="err"> </span> <span class="n">lin_fib_iter</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="c1"># While lin_fib_iter is a recursive procedure,</span>
<span class="c1"># computation itself is iterative.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Let's crunch some numbers and do benchmarking:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">Benchmark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bmbm</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Rehearsal -------------------------------------------</span>

</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Even for a small number such as 1000, iterative solution is more than 10 times faster (for the first execution). This is expected, since the iterative solution has linear, while the first solution has exponential growth WRT n. Although the tree-recursive-memoized version is about 30 times faster the second time (everything is already cached) it is not right approach for the given problem (not just because "stack level too deep" error begins to occur already at n = 1500 ). This does not  imply that tree recursive processes are useless. On contrary they can be natural solutions for some classes of problems.</p>

<p><em>Note: Implementations of the Fibonnaci functions are translated from their orginal Scheme versions which can be found in
the one of the CS's classics:  <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>.</em></p>
