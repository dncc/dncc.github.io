I've found today an elegant and intuitive approach to derive equations of present and
future values for $n$ annuity payments ($pv_{n}, fv_{n}$). It doesn't require much algebraic
manipulation and its quite easy to visualize. I'm going to write it down so I have reference.
</p>

<p>
This is also opportunity for me to try <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MatJax.js</a>, JavaScript library for writing LaTeX formulas in HTML :).
</p>

<p>
Let's just imagine two infinitely long time lines of payments. At first timeline
payments start at point 1 and at the second timeline they start at time n+1.
Here is what they might look like:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">    -------| Payment Timeline1 |-------&gt;

            pmt<span class="o">(</span>1<span class="o">)</span>    pmt<span class="o">(</span>2<span class="o">)</span>     pmt<span class="o">(</span>N<span class="o">)</span>    pmt<span class="o">(</span>n+1<span class="o">)</span>   pmt<span class="o">(</span>n+2<span class="o">)</span>  pmt<span class="o">(</span>Inf<span class="o">)</span>
    |---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
    0         1         2    ...   n         n+1        n+2  ...  Inf


    -------| Payment Timeline2 |------&gt;
                                           pmt<span class="o">(</span>1<span class="o">)</span>     pmt<span class="o">(</span>2<span class="o">)</span>    pmt<span class="o">(</span>Inf<span class="o">)</span>
    |---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
    0         1         2    ...   n         n+1        n+2  ...  Inf
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>
Where pmt(1), pmt(2), ... etc. are obviously payments at time 1, 2, ... etc,
and we assume that all payments are equal to each other (i.e. pmt(1) = pmt(2) = ... = pmt(Inf) = pmt).
</p>
<p>
Once we are finished, it will be enough to keep this image in our mind in order
to derive the $pv_{n}$ and $fv_{n}$ formulas. No need to remember long sequences of algebraic
calculations any more. Just two infinite time axis with different starting points (it can't be
much easier than that :)). Enough talk, let's make use of our pretty image now.
</p>

<p>
The simple fact of finance says that in order to obtain present values we have to discount them
with interest rate $r$. So the present values on Timeline1 at point in time 0 ($PIT_{0}$) for
payments pmt(1), pmt(2), ..., pmt(n), ..., pmt($\infty$). will be equal to:

\begin{equation}
pv_{1} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)}, pv_{2} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^2},
..., pv_{n} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^n}, ..., pv_{\infty} = \frac{pmt}{(1+r)^{\infty}}
\end{equation}

respectively. So the sum of all present value payments on Timeline1 will be:

$$ pv_{Timeline1} = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} pv(i) = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}
\frac{pmt}{(1+r)^i} = pmt * \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}.$$

Now, note that the present values at $PIT_{n}$ on Timeline2 are equal exactly
to the present values on Timeline1 at $PIT_{0}$. So in order to obtain present
values at $PIT_{0}$ on Timeline2 we need to additionally discount all present
values at $PIT_{n}$ on this timeline with $\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}$ discount factor.
If we do this the sum of all present value payments on Timeline2 will be:

$$ pv_{Timeline2} = pv_{Timeline1} * \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}. $$

Now we have formulas with lots of summation terms (for infinite number of future
payments), so we need something simpler, shorter and more handy in order to calculate
$pv_{n}$ and $fv_{n}$ values of $n$ future payments. In order to get there we need to
know just one small mathematical truth about, so called, geometric progressions.
Let's see what they are.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
 Geometric progression of A (where A is constant less than 1) can be defined as
 follows: $$ S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} A^i $$

 It is easy to see that $$S = \frac{A}{1-A},$$ we just multiply $S$ with $A$
 so that $A*S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} A^{i+1}$ and when substract $S*A$ from $S$
 we get $S - S*A = A$, and indeed $S = \frac{A}{1-A}$.
</p></blockquote>


<p>
If we apply this cute trick to the sumation term of $pv_{Timeline1}$ equation we can
simplify it significantly:

$$
 pv_{Timeline1} = pmt * \Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+r)^i} = pmt * \frac{\frac{1}{(1+r)^i}}{1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}}  = \frac{pmt}{r}.
$$

So $pv_{Timeline2}$ becomes:

$$
 pv_{Timeline2} = \frac{pmt}{r} * \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}.
$$

Now, if we substract $pv_{Timeline2}$ from $pv_{Timeline1}$ we will get simple
formula for the present value of the first $n$ payments:

$$
 pv_{n} = pv_{Timeline1} - pv_{Timeline2} = \frac{pmt}{r} - \frac{pmt}{r}*\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\
        = pmt * \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r*(1+r)^n} \right).
$$

Voila! There it is, our first formula. The second equation (for future value of $n$ annuities - $fv_{n}$) can be obtained
from the first ($pv_{n}$) even more easily. It is just present value of $n$ annuities compounded to $n$ periods. So:

$$
 fv_{n} = pv_{n} * (1+r)^n = pmt * \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r*(1+r)^n} \right) * (1+r)^n \\
        = pmt * \left( \frac{(1+r)^n}{r} - \frac{1}{r} \right).
$$

<h1> <a href="/blog/2013/04/28/Awk-One-Liner.html"> Parsing Gem Versions With Awk </a> </h1>

<div class="date">
    published: 28 Apr 2013
</div>

<p>I installed latest Ruby (2.0.0-p0) today and along with it the smallest gem
versions from the previous Ruby (2.0.0-rc1). Here is awk one-liner that helped
me do that.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">chruby 2.0.0-rc1

gem list | <span class="se">\</span>
    awk <span class="s1">&#39;{ gsub(/\(|\)/, &quot;&quot;); line = line &quot; -v=&quot; $NF &quot; &quot; $1; } \</span>
<span class="s1">    END  {print line; }&#39;</span> &gt; gems-versions

chruby ruby-2.0.0-p0
gem install <span class="sb">`</span>cat gems-versions<span class="sb">`</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>First, I switched to ruby-2.0.0-rc1 with 'chruby' in order to make a list of available
gems. Then, in order to parse the list of gems I piped it to the awk command. Here is
what it does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removes parenthesis that enclose gem versions in each line with <em>gsub(/\(|\)/, "")</em>.</li>
<li>Concatenates gem version with its name in a single line in the form that the
 <em>gem install</em> command understands (i.e -v=&lt;gem-version> &lt;gem-name>) with
 <em>line=line " -v="$NF" " $1</em>. <em>$NF</em> and <em>$1</em> denote the gem's version number
 and name respectively.</li>
<li>Prints the concatenated line in the <em>'gems-versions'</em> file at the end.</li>
</ul>


<p>After I created the list of gems I switched to ruby-2.0.0-p0 and installed gems with:
<em>gem install `cat gems-versions`</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to adjust this to the similar use cases. If we want, for instance,
to install all gem versions that are already present in the previous Ruby
version the awk that will parse all gem versions will look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">chruby ruby-2.0.0-p0

gem list | <span class="se">\</span>
    awk <span class="s1">&#39;{ gsub(/\)/,&quot;&quot;); gsub(/\(|,\s/, &quot; &quot; $1&quot;:&quot;); \</span>
<span class="s1">    $1=&quot;&quot;; line = line &quot; &quot; $0} END { print line }&#39;</span> &gt; gems-versions

chruby ruby-2.0.0-p0
gem install <span class="sb">`</span>cat gems-versions<span class="sb">`</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Everything is almost the same as in the previous case except there are
a couple of extra awk commands to add.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>gsub(/)/,""); gsub(/(|,\s/, " " $1":")</em> replaces string
<em>xgem (2.0, 1.0)</em> with <em>xgem xgem:2.0 xgem:1.0</em></li>
<li><em>$1=""</em> sets the first field (a gem name) to the empty string so the
output string becomes <em>gem_x:1.0 gem_x:2.0</em> which should be valid
input for the <em>gem install</em> command.</li>
<li><em>line = line " " $0</em> concatenates the output string <em>$0</em> to the <em>line</em>
variable which will be saved to the <em>gems-versions</em> file.</li>
</ul>

<h1> <a href="/blog/2013/01/27/Automount-USB-With-Udisks-in-Arch-Linux.html"> Automount With Udisks in Arch Linux </a> </h1>

<div class="date">
    published: 27 Jan 2013
</div>

<p>When it became obvious that <em>systemd</em> was going to replace <em>sysvinit</em> and
<em>init scripts</em> I switched to <em>systemd</em> and experienced several issues in the
process. One of those was that the system couldn't automount usb drives
any more.</p>

<p>Before the transition I used <em>devmon</em> which was started in <em>.xinitrc</em>
before windows manager with <em>ck-launch-session bash -c "devmon &amp; ..."</em>
command and it worked seamlessly. However, after the upgrade
the devmon was broken. No matter whether it was issued manually in
terminal or from the .xinitrc script, it reported the following error:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">Poll for media failed: Not Authorized
    device: [/dev/sdb1]
    ...
    mountdev /dev/sdb1 DNC vfat
devmon: mount /dev/sdb1 --mount-options noexec,nosuid,noatime    (DNC)
Mount failed: Not Authorized
devmon: error mounting /dev/sdb1 (0)
...
udisks functions are not authorized through policykit,
so devmon cannot automount drives.
...
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I also tried <em>udiskie</em>, another automatic disk mounter that uses
<em>udisks</em>, and it failed to mount disk with the similar message:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">attempting to mount device /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1 (vfat:[])
failed to mount device /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1:
  org.freedesktop.UDisks.Error.PermissionDenied: Not Authorized
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Obviously the problem was not <em>devmon</em>, nor <em>udiskie</em>. Somehow <em>udisks</em> functions
were no longer authorized through <em>policykit</em>... It was clear that I should
famialirize myself with <em>polkit</em> and find out how to authorize <em>udisks</em> actions.</p>

<p>From <em>polkit(8)</em> manpages I learned that in order to authorize
disk mounting I should write <em>polkit</em> rule. These rules are placed in
<em>/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/</em> and <em>/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/</em> directories in
files with <em>.rules</em> extension. Both directories are monitored by <em>polkitd</em>
process. If rule is changed, added or removed all rules are processed
again.</p>

<p>So I added <em>/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-udisks-automount.rules</em> file with
the following rule:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">polkit</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addRule</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">subject</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount&quot;</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span>
                <span class="nx">subject</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">isInGroup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;storage&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">polkit</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">YES</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Basically it says that <em>udisks</em> mount action should be allowed to the users
in the <em>storage</em> group. Values for <em>action.id</em> as well as other information
about <em>polkit</em> authorization policies can be found in <em>/usr/share/polkit-1/actions</em>
directory. Particularly, the policy for the <em>udisks</em> is placed in
<em>org.freedesktop.udisks.policy</em> file. All rules are written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>After I'd added this rule, <em>devmon</em> and <em>udiskie</em> started to work as expected
so I haven't searched further. For that reason I suppose that what I've presented
here is probably quick and dirty solution. It should serve just as a remainder
to me in the future and it might also help someone with the similar problem.
More comprehensive coverage of <em>udev</em>, <em>udisks</em> and <em>polkit</em> can be found on the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev#Udisks">Arch wiki pages for udev</a>
and with <em>man polkit(8)</em>.</p>
