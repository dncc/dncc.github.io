<h1> <a href="/blog/2012/08/09/Browse-and-change-code-history-with-GIT.html"> Browse and change code history with Git </a> </h1>

<div class="date">
    published: 09 Aug 2012
</div>

<p>Sometimes, if I really want to understand a peace of software, I embark on browsing its whole history available in Git. I usually checkout its initial commit and than slowly make my way through the forest of subsequent commits and branches. If the project is the important one and has live and vibrant community I also consult mailing list archives for the point of time when a particular commit is made. This way, not only that I learn what were the original drivers and ideas of the current design, but often I gain deep insights about evolution of the project and its dynamics.</p>

<p>I'll write now about some Git commands from its time-traveling-and-history-changing toolbox that I use in this setting.</p>

<p>Let's assume the following history exists and the current branch is "develop":</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">               A---B---C---D---E---X develop
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Now let's say that I'm on commit B where some particularly complicated algorithm is introduced. As I have hard time understanding the algorithm I write lots of printf's, comments and proof-of-concept code all over the place. Also, I often try to do the same thing that is done in the code differently and sometimes (especially when I make a mistake) I see why the author had chosen the particular way of doing it.</p>

<p>This meta-code helps me to really understand the original source and forces me to learn and adopt good practices and ideas from it. It has a tremendous value for me because if I need to check the algorithm at the point B again I will, hopefully, understand it and know how to reuse it much more quickly with this meta-code explanations. As I want to preserve this for the future I create commits along the way and usually group them in separate 'code-review' branch.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">git checkout -b code-review &lt;B-sha1&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Next, I write explanatory comments, log messages and tests for commit B in commits F, G, H on the code-review branch so my git repository looks something like this</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">                     F---G---H code-review
                    /
               A---B---C---D---E---X develop
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>When I'm done with reviewing commit B I move further down the main developing line to commits C, D, and E. Let's say the code there consists just of smaller tweaks of the algorithm that is introduced at the point B. I understand everything without need to write additional meta-code and I want to integrate them in my code-review branch so I can move on to another commits down the develop branch.</p>

<p>The easiest way to integrate C, D and E with <em>all</em> previous code-review commits (F, G, H) is to use git <em>rebase</em> command (at this point I would be in 'code-review' branch):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">git rebase &lt;E-sha1&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>So I end up with the following repository:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">                                 F---G---H code-review
                                /
               A---B---C---D---E---X develop
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>However, let's say I want to integrate only commits F and G with the C, D, and E from the develop branch. In that case I would use git <em>rebase</em> with --onto option as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">git rebase --onto &lt;E-sha1&gt; &lt;B-sha1&gt; &lt;G-sha1&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This basically says <em>move all commits between B (not including it) and G (including it) onto E commit</em>. After the command is successfully finished the repository should look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">                                 F---G code-review
                                /
               A---B---C---D---E---X develop
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In practice often some conflicts arise along the way. To efficiently resolve them I recommend <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/git-scripts/blob/master/git-rm-conflicts">git-rm-conflicts</a> script written by John Wiegley.</p>

<p>The script that is written bellow is, also, very handy for reviewing branches and project history:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit develop code-review
some-other-branch
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>You can add <em>-p</em> to see detailed diffs, leave off <em>--pretty=...</em> to see whole log messages, or tweak it some other way to suit your needs.</p>

<div class="date">
    published: 09 Jun 2012
</div>

<p>The easiest way to rotate Rails 3.2 log files (and they can get
really huge) is to put the following line in the 'config/environments/development.rb' file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">AppName</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Application</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="c1"># auto rotate 2 log files with 5MB each</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">logger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">paths</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;log&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">megabytes</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p><em>Note: in the earlier versions you could access log file name with
"config.paths.log.first" call. Not the case any more.
Now you have to use hash notation as in the snippet above.</em></p>

<h1> <a href="/blog/2012/05/26/Installing-JAGS-and-rjags-on-arch.html"> Installing JAGS and rjags on Arch Linux </a> </h1>

<div class="date">
    published: 26 May 2012
</div>

<p>I have been evaluating available options for developing Bayesian and state-space models in R recently so I stumbled upon JAGS and rjags. Since I had trouble to install them on Arch Linux I thought it might be good to create a brief record of the whole process. the thread that was useful to me to identify and solve the problem is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/forums/forum/610037/topic/4996525">here</a>
.</p>

<p>JAGS installation went well. There was no standard Arch package for JAGS so I built it from the source, which was straightforward:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I found this <a href="http://quote.ucsd.edu/blogs/rogblog/2008/11/09/installing-rjags-on-64-bit-debian-etch/">post</a> which describes that you should specify <em>'--with-jags-modules' and '--libdir'</em> options at configuration stage if you are on 64-bit architecture, but it seems this is no more needed (All jags libs were placed in '/usr/local/lib' directory, not in 'lib64' as it was the case at the time the post was written).</p>

<p>Next, I tried to install 'rjags' package within R:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">install.packages(&#39;rjags&#39;)
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>and I got this error message:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">...
*** installing help indices
** building package indices ...
Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for &#39;rjags&#39;, details:
call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
error: unable to load shared object
&#39;/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rjags/libs/rjags.so&#39;:
libjags.so.3: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory
ERROR: installing package indices failed *
removing &#39;/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/rjags&#39;
...
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>First, I tried various things with the previous R function (some of which, for instance, were to include 'dependecies=TRUE' and jags module paths as arguments to this function). That didn't work. After quite a few failed trials I found out that jags libraries were in '/usr/local/lib' directory and it was not included in my linker path. I checked this with:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">sudo ldconfig -p | grep <span class="nb">local</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>and since '/usr/local/lib' didn't appear on <em>stdout</em> I added this line in the new '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/jags.conf' file. Than, in order to activate linker paths and check if '/usr/local/lib' was included I run:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">sudo ldconfig -v | grep /usr/local/lib
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I tried 'rjags' installation again with:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">sudo R --with-jags-modules=/usr/local/lib/JAGS/modules-3 \
CMD INSTALL ~/downloads/rjags_3-2.tar.gz
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>and this time it was installed!</p>

<p>It remains just to develop some Bayesian models for predicting a stock price movements or whatever, and make myself awfully rich ;).</p>
